      Note that several tags are generated during build. Make sure to check the 
      index.html that is produced (in the build folder) before adding tags,
      because if you add anything here that is generated in the head there, it
      will be overwritten. That applies to the below tags.
    -->
    <link rel="icon" href="%PUBLIC_URL%/logo.svg" sizes="any" type="image/svg+xml">
    <meta name="theme-color" content="#158CBA" />
    <link rel="manifest" href="%PUBLIC_URL%/manifest.json" />
    <!--
      Make sure to use %PUBLIC_URL% where you would put the site root. It will 
      be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build. Only 
      files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.
